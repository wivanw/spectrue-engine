# Governance & Non-Influence Guarantees  
*Spectrue Project*

## 1. Purpose of Governance

Spectrue operates in a domain where even the perception of hidden influence can undermine trust.

This document describes the governance principles and structural safeguards that prevent external or internal actors from influencing analytical outcomes, evidence evaluation, or uncertainty handling.

Governance in Spectrue is designed to **limit authority**, not to centralize it.

---

## 2. Separation of Control and Analysis

Spectrue enforces a strict separation between:

- **analytical logic** (how claims are analyzed),
- **economic inputs** (payments, subscriptions, donations),
- and **operational control** (deployment, scaling, user access).

No component that handles funding, payments, or growth metrics has the ability to:
- modify analytical rules,
- alter evidence weighting,
- suppress uncertainty,
- or influence verdict aggregation.

This separation is architectural, not procedural.

---

## 3. No Financial Influence on Outcomes

Financial contribution does not grant any form of analytical privilege.

Specifically:
- paid users do not receive preferential analysis,
- payments cannot elevate sources or suppress evidence,
- donations cannot influence rankings, tiers, or uncertainty statuses.

All analytical outputs are produced by the same logic, regardless of payment status.

This rule is enforced at the system design level and is not subject to discretionary override.

---

## 4. No Editorial or Political Control

Spectrue does not accept:
- sponsored outcomes,
- paid source elevation,
- political partnerships that influence analysis,
- or contractual obligations that restrict analytical conclusions.

The project does not act as an editorial authority and does not curate narratives.

Any attempt to introduce editorial control over analytical outputs is considered incompatible with the project’s mission.

---

## 5. Source Tiers as Inspectable Criteria, Not Negotiation

If source tiers or trust levels are used, they are governed by:
- documented criteria,
- observable behavior,
- and auditable evidence patterns.

Inclusion, exclusion, or movement between tiers:
- cannot be purchased,
- cannot be negotiated privately,
- and cannot be enforced contractually.

Sources improve their standing only by improving their verifiable behavior.

---

## 6. Open Principles, Closed Attack Surface

While analytical principles and governance rules are public, operational systems are intentionally protected.

User-facing infrastructure, abuse-prevention logic, and deployment mechanisms are not fully open, as unrestricted access would increase manipulation and gaming risks.

This is a security decision, not a transparency compromise.

Transparency is applied where it increases trust; opacity is applied where it prevents abuse.

---

## 7. Maintainer Authority and Its Limits

The project maintainer has authority over:
- development direction,
- architectural decisions,
- and implementation details.

The maintainer does not have authority to:
- override analytical outcomes,
- alter results for specific actors,
- or introduce hidden influence pathways.

Maintainer decisions are constrained by publicly documented principles and open-source scrutiny.

---

## 8. Funding Without Capture

Spectrue accepts:
- public-interest grants,
- community support,
- and transparent user payments.

Spectrue does not pursue venture funding or ownership structures that introduce growth pressure, exit incentives, or external control over governance.

Funding sources do not receive governance privileges beyond what is publicly documented.

---

## 9. Handling Conflicts and Pressure

In cases of external pressure, controversy, or disagreement:

- analytical logic is not modified reactively,
- uncertainty is surfaced rather than suppressed,
- and unresolved cases remain unresolved.

Discomfort is not treated as a failure mode.

---

## 10. Evolution of Governance

These governance guarantees are not static.

Changes to governance principles:
- must be documented publicly,
- must preserve or strengthen non-influence guarantees,
- and must not introduce new hidden control paths.

Backward compatibility of trust is treated as a first-class concern.

---

## 11. Accountability Through Transparency

Spectrue does not rely on trust in individuals.

It relies on:
- inspectable logic,
- documented constraints,
- and visible failure modes.

If trust in Spectrue exists, it is because the system makes abuse difficult — not because it promises restraint.
