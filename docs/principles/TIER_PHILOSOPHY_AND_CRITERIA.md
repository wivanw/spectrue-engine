# Tier Philosophy & Criteria  
*Spectrue Project*

## 1. Purpose of Tiers

Tiers in Spectrue are not endorsements, ratings, or judgments of intent.

They exist to:
- make source behavior visible,
- reduce implicit trust assumptions,
- and incentivize verifiable improvement in information quality.

Tiers describe **observed analytical patterns**, not reputation or authority.

---

## 2. What a Tier Is — and Is Not

A Tier is:

- a summary of how a source behaves over time under analysis,
- derived from observable, repeatable evidence patterns,
- and updated based on documented criteria.

A Tier is not:
- a declaration of truthfulness,
- an editorial approval,
- a moral judgment,
- or a permanent status.

Tiers can change.

---

## 3. Behavior, Not Identity

Spectrue evaluates **content behavior**, not institutional identity.

This means:
- no source is trusted by default,
- no source is distrusted by default,
- and no source is permanently locked into a Tier.

Improvement and degradation are both possible outcomes.

---

## 4. Criteria-Based, Not Negotiated

Tier placement is governed by publicly documented criteria.

Inclusion, exclusion, or movement between Tiers:
- cannot be purchased,
- cannot be negotiated privately,
- and cannot be enforced contractually.

There are no paid certifications, partnerships, or sponsorships related to Tiers.

---

## 5. Evidence-Centered Evaluation

Tier assessment is derived from aggregate analytical signals, including:
- consistency of factual claims,
- frequency of unresolved or underspecified assertions,
- responsiveness to corrections,
- citation quality and traceability,
- and alignment between claims and primary sources.

No single article or analysis determines Tier placement.

---

## 6. Transparency Over Finality

Tiers do not hide uncertainty.

If a source produces:
- high volumes of ambiguous claims,
- poorly specified assertions,
- or structurally unverifiable content,

this is surfaced analytically rather than normalized or averaged away.

A Tier reflects how often such patterns occur — not a final judgment.

---

## 7. No Enforcement, Only Visibility

Spectrue does not enforce consequences based on Tier placement.

There are:
- no penalties,
- no takedowns,
- no suppression mechanisms.

The system provides visibility, not enforcement.

How Tiers are interpreted or acted upon is left to users, platforms, and communities.

---

## 8. Incentives for Improvement

The purpose of Tiers is not exclusion, but incentive alignment.

Sources improve their standing by:
- improving claim specificity,
- strengthening evidence attribution,
- correcting errors transparently,
- and reducing reliance on unsupported assertions.

Tier movement reflects these changes over time.

---

## 9. Right to Change Without Permission

Sources do not need approval to improve.

There is:
- no application process,
- no appeal board,
- no approval authority.

Behavioral change is sufficient.

This avoids gatekeeping and preserves independence.

---

## 10. Inspectable Methodology

Tier criteria and aggregation logic are documented and inspectable.

While operational safeguards prevent gaming, the principles governing Tier behavior are public.

This ensures:
- accountability,
- reproducibility,
- and resistance to hidden bias.

---

## 11. Limits of Tiering

Tiers do not resolve truth.

They do not:
- replace human judgment,
- override context,
- or guarantee correctness.

They exist to reduce blind trust, not to eliminate disagreement.

---

## 12. A Long-Term Effect

Over time, Tiers aim to shift incentives:
- from authority-based credibility,
- to behavior-based accountability.

If sources compete for higher Tiers, it is not because Spectrue demands it —  
but because transparency becomes reputationally valuable.

## 13. Future Direction: Automated Tier Discovery and Self-Nomination (Planned)

Spectrue’s Tier model is intended to evolve toward greater scalability while preserving non-authoritative and non-negotiated governance.

A planned direction is **automated Tier discovery**, where the system periodically analyzes publicly available content from a source and computes Tier-relevant metrics over time. Based on these metrics, a source may be automatically suggested for inclusion in a Tier or for Tier movement.

Key constraints:
- Tier movement remains **criteria-based**, not negotiated.
- Sources cannot purchase or contract their way into a Tier.
- Automated Tier suggestions are based on aggregated analytical signals, not single articles.

In addition, sources may **self-nominate** for analysis by submitting their domain or content feeds for evaluation. Self-nomination does not grant preferential treatment; it only provides a clear path for voluntary inclusion in the evaluation process.

This roadmap item is intended to increase transparency and reduce manual gatekeeping, not to create a centralized certification authority.
