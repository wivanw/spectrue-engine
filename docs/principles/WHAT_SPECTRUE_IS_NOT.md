# What Spectrue Is Not  
*Spectrue Project*

This document clarifies common misconceptions about Spectrue by explicitly stating what the project does **not** aim to be, do, or represent.

It exists to reduce false assumptions, prevent misuse of authority, and protect users from misleading interpretations.

---

## Spectrue Is Not a Truth Authority

Spectrue does not determine what is true.

It does not issue final judgments, official truths, or binding conclusions.  
It exposes evidence, uncertainty, and analytical structure.

Truth remains a human responsibility.

---

## Spectrue Is Not an Arbiter of Acceptable Speech

Spectrue does not moderate content.

It does not remove posts, suppress sources, downrank opinions, or enforce compliance.  
No content is blocked or penalized by Spectrue.

The system provides visibility, not enforcement.

---

## Spectrue Is Not a Certification Body

Spectrue does not certify sources, publishers, or institutions.

Tiers are not certificates, endorsements, or seals of approval.  
They are analytical summaries of observed behavior over time.

No source is “approved” by Spectrue.

---

## Spectrue Is Not Neutral by Suppression

Spectrue does not aim for neutrality by hiding uncertainty.

When evidence is missing, conflicting, or structurally insufficient, this is surfaced explicitly rather than averaged away.

Discomfort and ambiguity are treated as valid analytical outcomes.

---

## Spectrue Is Not a Product That Sells Truth

Spectrue does not sell correctness.

Payment does not grant:
- better analytical outcomes,
- preferred treatment,
- or suppression of uncertainty.

Paid usage funds capacity, not authority.

---

## Spectrue Is Not a Closed or Proprietary Standard

While user-facing systems are protected for security reasons, Spectrue does not rely on proprietary analytical logic.

The core engine, principles, and governance rules are open and inspectable.

No hidden rules determine outcomes.

---

## Spectrue Is Not Responsible for Third-Party Claims of Usage

The Spectrue engine is open source.

Third parties may reuse the engine for purposes that do not align with Spectrue’s principles.  
Such reuse does not imply endorsement, alignment, or legitimacy.

Claims of being “powered by Spectrue” are not equivalent to operating under Spectrue governance.

---

## Spectrue Is Not a Weapon Against Disagreement

Spectrue does not exist to “win arguments”.

It does not:
- silence opposing views,
- enforce consensus,
- or replace debate.

It makes analytical structure visible so disagreement can be informed rather than blind.

---

## Spectrue Is Not Immutable

Spectrue is not finished.

Its principles, governance, and methodologies are expected to evolve transparently as new challenges emerge.

Change is constrained by public documentation, not private decisions.

---

## What Spectrue Is

Spectrue is analytical infrastructure designed to make evidence, uncertainty, and limitations visible.

If someone encounters Spectrue through misuse, misrepresentation, or hostile deployment, the project’s response is not denial or control — but clarity.

Understanding begins with distinction.
