# Independence & Free Access — Grant-Ready Summary
*Spectrue Project*

## Purpose

Spectrue is an analytical infrastructure project designed to maximize free, inspectable access to information verification without central authority, proprietary logic, or financial influence over outcomes.

The project combines:
- an open-source analytical engine,
- a user-facing product for accessibility,
- and a transparent economic model that structurally funds free access.

This document summarizes the principles that govern Spectrue’s independence and access model for grant reviewers.

## Independence by Design

Spectrue operates in a domain where trust cannot be claimed — it must be inspectable.

For this reason:
- the analytical engine is open source and auditable,
- analytical logic, evidence evaluation, and uncertainty handling cannot be influenced by payment,
- no external investor or partner has control over analytical outcomes.

Independence in Spectrue refers to independence of process, not neutrality of results.
Outcomes may reflect evidence asymmetries or uncertainty, but the process that produces them remains transparent and inspectable.

## Open Engine, Scoped Product

The Spectrue engine is published as open-source infrastructure to allow inspection, reuse, and audit.

User-facing products, operational infrastructure, and abuse-prevention mechanisms are intentionally not open-sourced, as unrestricted access to these layers would increase manipulation and security risks without improving analytical transparency.

This separation ensures:
- maximal transparency where it increases trust,
- controlled exposure where it prevents abuse.

---

## Non-Authoritative Analysis

Spectrue explicitly rejects verdict-oriented fact-checking.

Instead of producing authoritative truth labels, the system:
- decomposes content into claims,
- retrieves auditable evidence candidates,
- exposes claim–evidence relationships,
- and preserves uncertainty as an explicit analytical output.

Unresolved or underspecified claims are treated as valid results, not failures.

This design limits central authority and prevents overconfidence in automated analysis.

---

## Free Access as a Structural Guarantee

Free access to verification is the primary objective of the project.

It is enforced through an internal Free Pool, which allocates analytical capacity for free users independently of discretionary decisions.

All paid usage contributes to this pool, including:
- subscriptions,
- credit purchases,
- and donations.

Payment increases analytical capacity — it does not buy preferential outcomes.

---

## Donations and Public Benefit

Donations are treated as mission-driven contributions rather than service payments.

A majority of donation value is automatically allocated to the Free Pool, making donations the most effective way to expand free access.

Paying users are explicitly informed that their contribution funds free verification for others, aligning individual incentives with public benefit.

---

## Sustainability Without Capture

Spectrue is not designed to maximize profit or growth.

Monetization exists to:
- sustain infrastructure,
- support long-term development,
- and protect free access over time.

The project does not pursue venture funding, as external ownership and growth pressure would compromise analytical independence.

Public-interest grants and community support are the only funding models compatible with the project’s goals.

---

## Intended Impact

Spectrue aims to raise the baseline of information integrity by making transparency and uncertainty visible.

The long-term goal is not to enforce truth, but to ensure that:
- lack of transparency becomes visible,
- unsupported claims are identifiable,
- and access to verification is not restricted by ability to pay.
