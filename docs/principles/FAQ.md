# FAQ for Skeptics  
*Spectrue Project*

This FAQ addresses common concerns, criticisms, and failure scenarios related to Spectrue’s design, governance, and open-source nature.

---

## “If Spectrue is open source, can others use the engine to promote propaganda?”

Yes. This is possible — and expected.

Open-source software can be reused for purposes that do not align with the original project’s values. Spectrue does not attempt to prevent reuse through obscurity or control.

Instead, Spectrue limits abuse through:
- transparent principles,
- documented governance constraints,
- and clear separation between the engine and official analytical outputs.

Using the Spectrue engine does not imply endorsement by the Spectrue project.

---

## “Can someone claim their system is ‘powered by Spectrue’ while producing biased results?”

They can claim technical usage, but they cannot claim alignment.

Spectrue makes a strict distinction between:
- **using the engine**, and
- **operating under Spectrue’s principles, governance, and Tier methodology**.

Only analyses produced under the official Spectrue governance model and documented criteria represent Spectrue’s analytical stance.

Misuse of the engine does not transfer legitimacy.

---

## “Why not restrict usage to prevent misuse?”

Restricting usage would undermine the project’s core objective: inspectable trust.

Spectrue prioritizes:
- transparency over control,
- resilience over restriction,
- and clarity over enforcement.

History shows that closed systems fail silently, while open systems allow misuse to be identified, scrutinized, and challenged publicly.

---

## “How can users distinguish official Spectrue analysis from third-party usage?”

Official Spectrue outputs are defined by:
- documented governance guarantees,
- public Tier philosophy and criteria,
- transparent uncertainty handling,
- and consistent analytical contracts.

Third-party systems may reuse the engine, but they do not inherit these guarantees unless they adopt and document them explicitly.

Spectrue does not attempt to police claims of usage — it documents what constitutes legitimacy.

---

## “Could Spectrue itself be captured or manipulated in the future?”

Spectrue is designed to make capture difficult, not impossible.

Safeguards include:
- open analytical logic,
- documented non-influence guarantees,
- structural separation between funding and analysis,
- and public principles that constrain future changes.

If these guarantees were violated, the violation would be visible.

---

## “Who decides what is true in Spectrue?”

No one.

Spectrue does not decide truth.  
It exposes evidence, uncertainty, and analytical structure.

Truth determination remains a human responsibility.

---

## “What happens if Spectrue makes a mistake?”

Errors are treated as signals, not exceptions.

Spectrue:
- preserves uncertainty,
- exposes gaps,
- and avoids collapsing ambiguity into confident outputs.

Mistakes are expected, visible, and correctable.

---

## “Isn’t this just another fact-checking authority?”

No.

Spectrue does not enforce conclusions, remove content, or mandate interpretation.

It provides analytical visibility.  
Authority remains decentralized.

---

## “Can sources appeal or negotiate their Tier?”

No.

There is:
- no negotiation,
- no certification process,
- and no contractual pathway to Tier placement.

Sources improve their standing only by improving observable behavior over time.

---

## “Could powerful actors pressure Spectrue?”

Pressure is expected in this domain.

Spectrue’s response is not compliance or defiance, but **non-reactivity**:
- analytical logic is not modified under pressure,
- unresolved cases remain unresolved,
- and discomfort is not treated as a failure mode.

---

## “Why trust Spectrue at all?”

Spectrue does not ask for trust.

It offers:
- inspectable logic,
- documented constraints,
- and visible failure modes.

Trust, if it exists, is a consequence — not a requirement.
