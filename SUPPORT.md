# Support

Spectrue Engine is open source. The maintainers prioritize:

1. reproducible bug reports (include a minimal trace JSONL),
2. correctness bugs that affect evidence isolation or scoring,
3. cost regressions (unexpected external call explosions),
4. security issues (see `SECURITY.md`).

## Reporting a bug

Please include:

- engine version / commit hash,
- the trace JSONL (redact secrets),
- input text (or a minimized reproduction),
- expected vs actual behavior.

## Security

If you believe you found a security issue, follow `SECURITY.md`.
